				********  CIS 2348 Final Project  ********


This project’s sole purpose is to demonstrate our understanding of the materials covered in CIS 

2348 throughout the Fall 2020 semester.

By demonstrating the knowledge gained in this class, we were instructed to design a program that 

manages the inventory of an electronics store. This program include a number of concepts covered 

in the class which include, but are not limited to:

	* Use of classes
	* Use of dictionaries
	* Sorting
	* Input and output of comma delimited csv files

We were given a number of files which were used to run queries and print the results.

In this interactive query we were instructed to:

	1. Have the user query an item by asking for a manufacturer and item type

	2. If an item is not listed in the manufacturer or item type inventory the following 	   

	   message is printer “No such item in inventory”

	3. If an item is listed then the following conditions are  printed 
	   - “Your item is:” ID, manufacturer name, item, and price included on one line. 
	   - Do not provide items that are past their service date or damaged.
	   - If there are more than one item, provide the most expensive item.

	4. If another manufacturer is in the inventory and is not damaged or past its service 	   

	   date, print “You may, also consider:” with information

	5. After the user completes the query, he/she may use ‘q’ to quit the program
